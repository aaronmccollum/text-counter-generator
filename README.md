# Text Counter and Generator App
App that counts text and also generates text the length of a user's input

## Text Counter
Directions to use:
1. Input/Paste text into the text box and submit
2. The character count will be returned to the right.
3. (note) The current returned character number includes returns. For pure character count, make sure to post just one paragraph (regardless of size) into the text box.

## Text Generator
Under construction for a future release.
- There will be a number input for users to specify how many characters of random text they want to generate. The app will provide exactly that.
- There will be a button to generate one paragraph of Lorem Ipsum text.
